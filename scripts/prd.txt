# Agro Mandiri E-commerce Reconditioning Project

## Project Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the plan to recondition the Agro Mandiri e-commerce application to align with industry best practices. The project aims to address identified issues, improve code quality, enhance type safety, and ensure overall maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Current State Summary
The Agro Mandiri e-commerce application is a Next.js-based web application for selling agricultural products. It has both customer-facing components and an administrative backend. While the application is functional, it has several issues including TypeScript errors, database schema mismatches, syntax errors, unused imports, and form handling inconsistencies.

## Project Goals
1. Resolve all identified code issues and bugs
2. Implement industry best practices throughout the codebase
3. Improve type safety and TypeScript usage
4. Align TypeScript interfaces with the database schema
5. Enhance error handling and form validation
6. Improve code organization and documentation
7. Implement testing infrastructure
8. Enhance security measures
9. Optimize performance
10. Create comprehensive documentation

## Scope of Work

### 1. TypeScript and Type Safety Improvements
- Fix all TypeScript errors in the codebase
- Replace any usage of 'any' types with specific types
- Create consistent type definitions for all components and functions
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all database operations
- Ensure type safety across the application

### 2. Database Schema Alignment
- Align TypeScript interfaces with the actual database schema
- Create systematic approach for field mapping between frontend and backend
- Document database schema and relationships
- Implement proper validation for database operations
- Resolve the unit_type field inconsistency

### 3. Code Quality and Structure
- Remove all unused imports and variables
- Fix syntax errors in components (especially settings/page.tsx)
- Implement consistent code formatting and styling
- Reduce code duplication through proper abstraction
- Add comprehensive comments and documentation
- Implement error boundaries for component failure handling

### 4. Form Handling and Data Flow
- Create consistent patterns for form submission
- Improve form state management
- Enhance validation error messages
- Standardize data transformation between forms and API
- Implement better handling of form fields that don't exist in the database

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up Jest for unit testing
- Implement React Testing Library for component testing
- Add Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Create test coverage for critical components and functionality
- Implement continuous integration workflow

### 6. Security Enhancements
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add input sanitization for user-generated content
- Enhance role-based access control
- Implement API rate limiting
- Conduct security audit and fix vulnerabilities

### 7. Performance Optimization
- Implement data pagination for large datasets
- Optimize image loading and processing
- Add comprehensive loading states
- Implement data prefetching for common user paths
- Optimize bundle size and code splitting

### 8. Documentation
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Document component architecture and usage
- Create database schema documentation
- Add setup and deployment instructions
- Provide maintenance guidelines

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The application must maintain all existing functionality
- User experience should remain consistent or improve
- Performance should be maintained or enhanced
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed
- Code must follow industry best practices
- Documentation must be comprehensive and up-to-date

## Project Timeline
The project is estimated to take 4-6 weeks to complete, with the following high-level phases:
1. Assessment and Planning (1 week)
2. Code Cleanup and Structure Improvements (1-2 weeks)
3. Type Safety and Database Alignment (1 week)
4. Testing Implementation (1 week)
5. Security and Performance Enhancements (1 week)
6. Documentation and Finalization (1 week)

## Success Criteria
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Database schema aligned with TypeScript interfaces
- No syntax errors or unused code
- Consistent form handling patterns implemented
- Test coverage of at least 70% for critical functionality
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Documentation completed and comprehensive
- Code passes all linting and formatting checks
- Successful deployment in production environment
